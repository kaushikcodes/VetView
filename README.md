VetView is a user-friendly app that allows pet owners to regularly track the health and wellness of their pets. Users can seamlessly upload pictures of their pet's bowel movements to the app. 
We have a neural network model that has been trained on a large dataset of different types of dog feces. We run the image uploaded by the user through the test function of this model to obtain a predicted class. 
Based on the predicted class, we make in-depth analysis about the eating habits and overall well-being of the dog. We also offer an expert AI opinion option that allows users to receive a personalized analysis.
